## Microbit Racing Game
### First Topic What is it and Why?

This repository is about the BO assignment of the input output project of this period. after looking trough out differnt options for this project the special input/output. I decided on a Microbit! i chose the microbit because i had easy access too the microbit. With the microbit, I am Working on a racing game using the motion sensors that are included in the microbit. I however had a few other options in mind that i wanted to work with instead of the microbit. for example:

* The adruino 
* Leap motion
* Hand tracking computer camera

I considerd all these options and tought about the pro's and cons. But eventually i chose the Microbit because, The leap motion wasn't available anymore wich cost me either time or money waiting on a new leap motion from school or buying my own to start with my own leap motion controller so i rulled this option out. Then i considerd and even started with the adruino at first but it seemed that this device didnt fit the project I had in mind wich was making a racing type of game. so i wanted a controller you could easely use and the adruino felt a little to big. so eventually i sticked with the microbit. I chose to handle this project alone because i like to work alone! This way it's my responsibilty on how the project eventually turns out,  and then i have a better view of what's going on. Now that i knew what to do for my project i got started. 

For this projected I needed software programming languages, a microbit device, unity program and resources of information to know how to connect the project together.

* Microbit device
* C# (primary programming language)
* Unity Engine
* python coding ( secondary programning language)
* Visual studio

This is what i needed for my projedct but the big problem was the lack of time and resources. I had allot of trouble finding any information about connecting Unity to the microbit, eventually i asked teachers for help and they recomended I use serializefield data to find the device in the C# code and connect it with unity. This way i could use the motion sensors that are in the microbit itself to make my own racing game controller. This was a perfect example of the Input/Output project.

## Microbit Racing Game

## Note! You can find the scene and the assets of the Unity game in the Master Branch!

### First Topic What is it and Why?

This repository is about the BO assignment of the input output project of this period. after looking trough out differnt options for this project the special input/output. I decided on a Microbit! i chose the microbit because i had easy access too the microbit. With the microbit, I am Working on a racing game using the motion sensors that are included in the microbit. I however had a few other options in mind that i wanted to work with instead of the microbit. for example:

* The adruino 
* Leap motion
* Hand tracking computer camera

I considerd all these options and tought about the pro's and cons. But eventually i chose the Microbit because, The leap motion wasn't available anymore wich cost me either time or money waiting on a new leap motion from school or buying my own to start with my own leap motion controller so i rulled this option out. Then i considerd and even started with the adruino at first but it seemed that this device didnt fit the project I had in mind wich was making a racing type of game. so i wanted a controller you could easely use and the adruino felt a little to big. so eventually i sticked with the microbit. I chose to handle this project alone because i like to work alone! This way it's my responsibilty on how the project eventually turns out,  and then i have a better view of what's going on. Now that i knew what to do for my project i got started. 

For this projected I needed software programming languages, a microbit device, unity program and resources of information to know how to connect the project together.

* Microbit device
* C# (primary programming language)
* Unity Engine
* python coding ( secondary programning language)
* Visual studio

This is what i needed for my projedct but the big problem was the lack of time and resources. I had allot of trouble finding any information about connecting Unity to the microbit, eventually i asked teachers for help and they recomended I use serializefield data to find the device in the C# code and connect it with unity. This way i could use the motion sensors that are in the microbit itself to make my own racing game controller. This was a perfect example of the Input/Output project. 

Now that i knew how to do it, I started working on the serializefield connection from the microbit to unity using python code at first. 


#Working out the idea

So i knew that i wanted to make a car controller with the microbit but now i needed to figure out what type of game I watned it to be, and to be honest my ambition was too big for the project time I had. First i made a simple original car in unity using 3D objects and messing them togheter. I also wanted to add an AI in the game to race against. but that didn't work out because i had to little time.

The disign idea and requirements.

* Screen with input display of the microbit
* X-axis and Y-axis reading
* Steering mechanic
* Button input
* plain field with road
* A car in unity
* Making a design document

I made all these things myself using research and creativity, this way it didn't cost me any money for special tutorials or Unity asset packages. So far I made the trello page and the Unity scene you can find that below in the github readme. So now i knew what I needed so it was time to start with the development!

#Development

eventually I got the microbit working and made a succesfull game product. Using my plan and going in head first! But during this project I got coivd-19 and that cost me two full weeks of time that i couldn't work on my project. Still I made it work. Using my own planning on different stages of the development.

First:
* Getting the microbit working with python
* then researching on serialised fields 
* using serialised field in C# to connect the microbit
* connection the python code so it can function in C#
* making a simple car model using 3D objects
* making a simple playfield
* reading the X and Y axis in unity
* making the car turn and move
* adding Buttons in the microbit python code
* connection the buttons in C#
* making buildings in the scene


##User Tests

I chose two friends who showed interest in my game during the building process to test my game, I focused on making a video of them testing my games. They mostly enjoyed the game but they had a little trouble getting used to the controles. You can see the video's of the user test below. 

I focussed on:

* The documentation
* Making a video using my phone
* I will show the video in my presentation
* I noted their questions in the readme below
* Plannend some questions to ask.

#Daniel Nijkamp

* Did the controls work properly?
: Yes but a bit clitchy 

* What more can I add to the game?
: an AI enemy to race against

*  What should I improve for the game?
: maybe make it a bit less laggy

#Byron van Herrewaarden

* Did the controls work properly?
  : yes, but because of the lag it hinderd the experience

* What more can I add to the game?
  : More mechanics like enemy's AI or ramps and more terrain hazzards

* What should I improve for the game?
  : The lag issue and maybe the buildings and surroundings.
